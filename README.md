# Supply Chain Traceability for Conflict-Free Minerals

A blockchain-based system for ensuring ethical sourcing of minerals through transparent tracking, verification, and certification across the entire supply chain.

## Core Components

### Mine Verification Contract
- Validates legitimacy and ethical practices of mining operations
- Records geographic coordinates and operational boundaries
- Documents compliance with local regulations and labor practices
- Creates immutable registry of approved extraction sites

### Material Tracking Contract
- Monitors minerals from extraction through refining and manufacturing
- Records chain of custody at each transfer point
- Implements batch tracking with unique identifiers
- Prevents mixing of verified and unverified materials

### Certification Contract
- Verifies compliance with international conflict-free standards
- Issues digital certificates for properly sourced materials
- Maintains registry of certification authorities and standards
- Enables verification by downstream buyers and consumers

### Audit Trail Contract
- Provides comprehensive record of mineral sourcing history
- Creates immutable documentation for regulatory compliance
- Enables third-party verification of ethical claims
- Supports consumer-facing transparency initiatives
